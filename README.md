# Single-View-Model
This is the third project of COMP5421.  
In this assignment you and your partner will create 3D texture-mapped models from a single image using the single view modeling method discussed in class. 
## Procedure  
  - Load in an image
  - Click on lines parallel to X,Y,Z axis
  - Compute vanishing points (Using cross product method or the Bob Collin's method)
  - Specify 3D and 2D positions of 4 pointison reference plane
  - Compute homography H
  - Specify a reference height
  - Compute 3D positions of several points
  - Create a 3D model from these points
  - Extract texture maps
  - Output a VRML model
## Result
1. raw image
